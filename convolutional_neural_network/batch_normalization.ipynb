    "# Batch Normalization\n",
    "## Unit Gaussian Activations\n",
    "Batch normalization is *invented* and widely popularized by the paper *Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift*. In deep neural network, activations between neural layers are extremely dependent on the parameter initialization, which in turn affects how outputs are backprop into each layer during training. Poor initialization can greatly affect how well a network is trained and how fast it can be trained. Networks train best when each layer has an unit Gaussian distribution for its activations. So if you really want unit Gaussian activations, you can make them so by applying batch normalization to every layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, batch normalization is a powerful technique for decoupling the weight updates from parameter initialization. Quoted from the paper, *batch normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization.* Let's consider a batch of activations at some layer, we can make each dimension (denoted by $k$) unit Gaussian by applying: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}^{(k)} = \\frac{x^{(k)} - E[x^{(k)}]}{\\sqrt{Var[x^{(k)}]}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each batch of training example has dimension `D`. Compute the empirical mean and variance independently for each dimension by using all the training data. Batch normalization is usually inserted after fully connected or convolutional layers and before nonlinearity is applied. For the convolutional layer, we are basically going to have one mean and one standard deviation per activation map that we have. And then we are going to normalize across all of the examples in the batch of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid Constraints by Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a `tanh` layer, we don't really want to constraint it to the linear regime. The act of normalization might force us to stay within the center, which is known as the linear regime. We want flexibility so ideally we should learn batch normalization as a paramter of the network. In other words, we should insert a parameter which can be learned to effectively cancel out batch normalization if the network sees fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply the following operation to each normalized vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y^{(k)} = \\gamma^{(k)}\\hat{x}^{(k)} + \\beta^{(k)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such that the network can learn\n",
    "\n",

    "\\gamma^{(k)} = \\sqrt{Var[x^{(k)}]} \\\\\n",
    "\\beta^{(k)} = E[x^{(k)}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And effectively recover the identity mapping as if you didn't have batch normalization, i.e. to cancel out the batch normalization if the network sees fit.\n",

    "> Note that simply normalizing each input of a layer may change what the layer can represent. For instance, normalizing the inputs of a sigmoid would constrain them to the linear regime of the nonlinearity. To address this, ew make sure that the transformation inserted in the network can represent the identity transform. \n",
