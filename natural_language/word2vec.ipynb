    "# Word2Vec - The Skip-Gram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of word2vec is actually quite simple. We want to train a 2-layer neural network to perform a fake task. The weights in the hidden layer will become our embedding vectors for our vocabulary in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fake Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a specific word in the middle of a sentence, find the probability for every word in our vocabulary of being the nearby *word*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I have a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Live as if you were to die tomorrow and learn as if you were to live forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "I pick *tomorrow* to be my center word. Now the neural network is supposed to tell me what is the probability of *die* being the nearby word of *tomorrow*. If it is properly trained, it should be close to one. Similarly if I ask the neural network, what is the probability of *live* being the nearby word of *tomorrow*, it should be close to zero.\n",

    "![skip-gram-model](./assets/skip-gram-model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is a word that gets translated into one-hot encoding. The encoding vector should have length of `V` where `V` represents the total vocabulary length. For example, if I have 10 unique words in my vocabulary, one of the words will be encoded as the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Each output is a vector of same length `V`; it contains the probability for all the words that they are the nearby word of the input center word. The output vector will contain float ranging from 0 to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "    [0.1, 0.23, 0.64, 0.45, 0, 0.523, 0.4, 0.9, 0.34, 0.85]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lookup Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Our neural network has two layers and two sets of weights. Suppose we have 1000 words in our vocabulary and 300 is our feature dimension. The first set of weights from the hidden layer will be our word vector lookup table after we finish training.\n",
    "\n",
    "![word2vec-lookup-table](./assets/word2vec-lookup-table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to actually create the model for performing such task. Let's define our word vector feature length to be `D=100`. "
