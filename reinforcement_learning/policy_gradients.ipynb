    "Suppose you want to train the agent such that it always takes the best action in every time step for a given state. The estimator does not specifically do that for you. It only looks at a whole trajectory and makes some estimation about what is good and what is bad. It does not train itself to make the best decision at every time step. Thus, although we may have a good reward trajectory, individual actions within this trajectory are not guaranteed to be the best choice. However, it works out if we have enough samples. The estimator requires a lot of samples to become unbiased in its gradient estimation. The challenge is, how can we reduce variance when samples are small.\n",
