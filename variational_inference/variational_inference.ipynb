    "> Many probablistic models are difficult to train because it is difficult to perform inference in them. In the context of deep learning, we usually have a set of visible variables $x$ and a set of latent variables $z$. The challenge of inference refers to the difficult problem of computing posterior $p(z \\mid x)$ or taking expectations with respect to it. Such operations are often necessary for tasks like maximum likelihood learning.\n",
