# RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)

## Table of Contents

* Vanilla RNN
* LSTM
* RNN implementation (`rnn`)

## How to run

Create a virtual environment

    virtualenv environment

Activate it

    source environment/bin/activate

Install pip dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Start jupyter notebook

    jupyter notebook

## Keras Example

Install tensorflow and keras using `pip`.

    pip install tensorflow
    pip install keras

For experimental data, download household power consumption dataset from [UCI Individual Household Electric Power Consumption][1] and put the text file under a folder named `datasets`.

Run `time_series_prediction.py` to experience how AWESOME LSTM is.

    python time_series_prediction
