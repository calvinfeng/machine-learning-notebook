# [Machine Learning Notebook](https://calvinfeng.gitbook.io/machine-learning-notebook/)

## Introduction

This is my personal machine learning notebook, used primarily for references and sharing what I
learned recently. I am slowly migrating my notes from everywhere to centralize them in one place on
GitBook. My notes are coming from the lectures I took from Stanford's CS229, CS231n and 224n. There
are also notes I took from working on my professional/personal projects using machine learning.
