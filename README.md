# [Machine Learning Notebook](https://calvinfeng.gitbooks.io/machine-learning-notebook/content/)

## Introduction
This is my personal machine learning notebook, used primarily for references and sharing what I 
learned recently. I am slowly migrating my notes from everywhere to centralize them in one place on 
GitBook. My notes are coming from the lectures I took from Stanford's CS229, CS231n and 224n. There 
are also notes I took from working on my professional/personal projects using machine learning. I 
will also include some other non-machine learning related topics in a sub section.

## Todo List
[ ] Variational Auto Encoder
[ ] Write a CNN example using CIFAR/NMIST datasets, since I have already written the code for it.
