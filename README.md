# [Machine Learning Notebook](https://calvinfeng.gitbook.io/machine-learning-notebook/)

## Introduction

This is my personal machine learning notebook, used primarily for references and sharing what I
learned recently. The source of the content primarily comes from courses I took from Stanford, i.e.
CS229, CS231n and CS224n and many other research papers, textbooks and online tutorials. There are
also notes I took from working on my professional/personal projects using machine learning.

## Table of Contents

The list is not sorted in any order.

* Clustering
* Simple Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Generative Adversial Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* Random Forest
* Reinforcement Learning
* Natural Language Processing
* Naive Bayesian Networks
* Recommender System
* Transferred Learning

The list is certainly expanding as I take new classes and learn new things from work.
