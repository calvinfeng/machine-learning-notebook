## Introduction
This is my personal machine learning notebook, used primarily for references and sharing what I learned recently. I am
slowly migrating my notes from everywhere to centralize them in one place on GitBook. I hope this notebook can benefit
whoever is reading this.

A lot of my notes are coming from Stanford's machine learning and image recognition course works. There are also notes I
took from working on my professional/personal projects using machine learning. I will also include some other
non-machine learning related topics in a sub section.
