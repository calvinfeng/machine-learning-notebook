    "# Spectral Clustering\n",
    "Here I will derive the mathematical basics of why does spectral clustering work. I will break them into four parts. The first three parts will lay the required groundwork for the mathematics behind spectral clustering. The final part will be piecing everything together and show that why that spectral clustering works as intended.\n",

    "## Part 2 - Lagrange Multiplier\n",
    "Lagrange multiplier is frequently used in classical mechanics to solve function optimization under constraints. Lagrangian mechanic is often used in non-relativistic quantum mechanics for particle physics, however that would require knowledge in path integral. In this section, I am sticking to the plain old Lagrange multipler to solve a simple constraint problem as an example. \n",

The easier example one can think of is that you want to a fence around your house, but the constraint is that you have limited materials from Home Depot. You want to maximize the area enclosed by your fence. Then you can use Lagrange Multiplier to perform the calculation and find the opitmal solution. \n",
